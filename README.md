Introductions
======
This project is fork from <https://github.com/git-game/git-game>.


## Why fork?
Just like this issue:[How to answer question?](https://github.com/git-game/git-game/issues/42) When I first saw the introduction, I didn't know how to use it. After thinking about it myself for a while, I knew how to finish the game. But I still feel the need to give a demo that allows first-time users to get started quickly and enjoy it. That's the reason for this project
